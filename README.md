# RL Comparison

Over time, I intend to compare the functionality and implement well known RL algorithm. I'm going to focus on the model-free domain, but over time I would like to cover the whole following map.

**NOTE:** I intend to write only small implementations of the algorithms when possible and based on other sources on the Internet. I don't intend to do hard detailed implementations of the algorithms. This source is only for understanding.
