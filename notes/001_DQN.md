# Deep Q-Learning (DQN)


## Overview

The authors proposed a variant of Q-Learning, which uses a neural network as the replacement of Q-matrix (tabular form), updated by stochastic gradient descent.

They handle

n asynchronous optimization method applicable to different model-free RL methods (value-based and policy-based), different update methods (on-policy and off-policy), and different domains (discrete and continuous).
